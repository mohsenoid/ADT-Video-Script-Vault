# 37. Kotlin: Exception Handling

## Best Practices of Exception Handling in Kotlin

**1. Introduction**

Hello Android Developers

In this video, I would like to cover the basics and some best practices of exception handling in Kotlin.

Handling exceptions gracefully in Android applications and in general any software is not just a best practice; it's an essential component of providing a reliable and positive user experience, because:

1. **Prevents Crashes:** Unhandled exceptions can cause applications to **crash unexpectedly**. This not only frustrates users but can also lead to data loss and other issues.
2. **Maintains User Trust:** Regular crashes can gradually **destroy user confidence and trust** in an application. Handling exceptions properly helps to maintain a smooth, consistent user experience, which is crucial for retaining users.
3. **Improves Debugging:** On the other hand, graceful handling of exceptions allows you to **log errors**. This can simplify the debugging process and make it easier to identify and fix underlying issues in upcoming releases.
4. **Enhances Security:** One thing you may not have though about is that unhandled exceptions can expose vulnerabilities and sensitive information. By managing exceptions thoughtfully, you can better safeguard the application and its data.
5. **User Experience Continuity:** And at last Handling exceptions ensures that users can continue their tasks even if something goes wrong. This can be achieved by displaying user-friendly error messages or fallback content.

**2. Basics of Exception Handling in Kotlin**

Now that we are all on the same page about the importance of exception handling let's talk about some basics that you probably know:

* **Definition of Exceptions:** Exceptions are unexpected events during program execution, that disrupt the normal flow. They can arise from various issues like invalid input, network failures, or resource constraints.
*   **Throwing Exceptions:** In Kotlin, you use the `throw` keyword to raise an exception manually. This is useful when you need to indicate an error state that the program should handle, such as throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` when a method receives invalid arguments.

    ```kotlin
    fun validateAge(age: Int) {
        if (age < 0) {
            throw IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative")
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Catching Exceptions:** The `try-catch` block in Kotlin allows you to catch and handle exceptions. By enclosing code that might throw exceptions in a `try` block and providing `catch` blocks for different types of exceptions, you can manage errors without crashing your application.

    ```kotlin
    try {
        val result = riskyOperation()
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        println("Caught an IOException: ${e.message}")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        println("Caught a general exception: ${e.message}")
    }
    ```
*   **Exceptions Are Bound to the Function Stack:** One point that might be ignored by developers is the fact that when an exception is thrown in Kotlin (or any JVM language), the JVM captures the current state of the call stack. This stack trace includes information about the sequence of method calls that led to the exception. If you start a new stack (for example, by creating a new thread or using a coroutine), the exception handling context changes. Each thread or coroutine has its call stack. If an exception is thrown within a new stack, it will only propagate within that stack. This means that exceptions thrown in a new thread or coroutine won't be caught by catch blocks in the original stack:

    ```kotlin
    fun main() {
        try {
            Thread {
                throw RuntimeException("Exception in new thread") // Won't be caught!
            }.start()
        } catch (e: RuntimeException) {
            println("Caught exception: ${e.message}")
        }
    }
    ```
* Throwing exceptions is expensive: Throwing exceptions in Kotlin, as in many other programming languages, can be considered expensive due to several reasons:
  * **Performance Overhead:** When an exception is thrown, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) needs to capture the current state of the stack, which involves creating a stack trace. This process is computationally intensive and can slow down the application
  * **Memory Usage:** Creating an exception object and its stack trace consumes memory. If exceptions are thrown frequently, this can lead to increased memory usage and potentially cause garbage collection issues
  * **Control Flow Disruption:** Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of the program, which can make the code harder to read and maintain. This disruption can lead to less efficient code paths being executed
  * **Error Handling Complexity:** Handling exceptions properly requires additional code for `try/catch` blocks, which can make the codebase more complex and harder to manage

**3. Best Practices**

After talking about basics, we can talk about exception-handling best practices:

*   **Avoid using exceptions for normal control flow (Kotlin in Action)**: Exceptions in Kotlin are meant to handle truly exceptional situations, not to manage routine tasks. Using exceptions for regular control flow can make the code harder to read and degrade performance. Instead, use conditional logic or other control structures. For example, instead of throwing an exception when a list is empty, you could use a conditional check:

    ```kotlin
    val list = listOf<Int>()
    if (list.isEmpty()) {
        println("List is empty")
    } else {
        println("First element: ${list[0]}")
    }
    ```
*   **Consider using \`Result\<T>\` or `sealed class/interface`:** This approach not only makes error handling more explicit but also improves the readability and maintainability of your code. By clearly separating success and error paths, you can avoid the performance overhead associated with exceptions and embrace a more functional programming style. This leads to more predictable and efficient code, aligning well with Kotlin's emphasis on safety and clarity.

    #### Example with `Result<T>:`

    ```kotlin
    fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): Result<Int> {
        return if (b != 0) {
            Result.success(a / b)
        } else {
            Result.failure(IllegalArgumentException("Division by zero"))
        }
    }

    val result = divide(4, 2)
    result.fold(
        onSuccess = { println("Result: $it") },
        onFailure = { println("Error: ${it.message}") }
    )
    ```

    #### Example with `sealed class/interface`:

    ```kotlin
    sealed interface DivisionResult {
        data class Success(val result: Int) : DivisionResult()
        data class Error(val message: String) : DivisionResult()
    }

    fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): DivisionResult {
        return if (b != 0) {
            DivisionResult.Success(a / b)
        } else {
            DivisionResult.Error("Division by zero")
        }
    }

    val result = divide(4, 2)
    when (result) {
        is DivisionResult.Success -> println("Result: ${result.result}")
        is DivisionResult.Error -> println("Error: ${result.message}")
    }
    ```
* **Use Kotlin's built-in exception classes (Kotlin in Action)**: Kotlin provides a variety of standard exception classes that should be used for common error scenarios. This ensures consistency and readability. Here are some of them:
  *   The `require()` function is a simple way to validate input arguments in Kotlin. It throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the condition isn't met, helping you catch issues early in the code execution. For example, use `require(age > 0) { "Age must be positive" }` to ensure age is a positive number.

      ```kotlin
      fun setAge(age: Int) {
          require(age > 0) { "Age must be positive" }
          // Proceed with setting age
      }
      ```
  *   The `requireNotNull`works the same as required but checks the value nullability and returns a non-null value. In this example, requireNotNull ensures that the user's name is not null. If it is null, it throws an IllegalArgumentException with the specified message:

      ```kotlin
      fun getUserInfo(user: User?) {
          val userName = requireNotNull(user?.name) { "User's name cannot be null" }
          println("User name: $userName")
      }
      ```
  *   The `check`function verifies a condition is true and if the condition fails, it throws an IllegalStateException with the provided message:

      ```kotlin
      class Car(val fuelLevel: Int) {

          fun drive() {
              check(fuelLevel > 0) { "Can't drive with an empty fuel tank" }
              println("Driving...")
          }
      }
      ```
  * You may ask yourself then what is the difference between `require` and `check`?
    * **Require:**
      * **Purpose**: Used to check preconditions of a function, i.e., conditions that must be true before the function is executed.
      * **Exception**: Throws `IllegalArgumentException` if the condition is not met.
      * **Use Case**: Typically used to validate inputs to a function.
    * **check:**
      * **Purpose**: Used to check the state of a function or object, i.e., conditions that should be true during the execution of the function.
      * **Exception**: Throws `IllegalStateException` if the condition is not met.
      * **Use Case**: Used to ensure that an object is in a valid state.
*   **Create custom exceptions when needed (Kotlin in Action)**: For scenarios that are unique to your application, create custom exceptions. This makes it easier to understand and handle specific error cases. Here's an example of a custom exception:

    ```kotlin
    class InvalidUserInputException(message: String) : Exception(message)
    ​
    fun validateUserInput(input: String) {
        if (input.isBlank()) {
            throw InvalidUserInputException("Input cannot be blank")
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Prefer using standard library exceptions (Kotlin in Action)**: Stick to exceptions provided by the Kotlin standard library for common error cases. They are well-documented and familiar to other developers. For example, use `IllegalStateException` for method calls that are illegal in a particular state:

    ```kotlin
    fun processOrder(order: Order) {
        check(order.isValid) { "Order is not valid" }
        // processing logic
    }
    ```
*   **Handle nullability properly (Effective Kotlin):** Leveraging Kotlin's null-safety features prevents `NullPointerExceptions` and improves code safety. Use the `?` operator to handle nullable types safely:

    ```kotlin
    val name: String? = getName()
    println(name?.toUpperCase() ?: "Name is null")
    ```
*   **Avoiding Checked Exceptions:** Unlike Java, Kotlin doesn't have checked exceptions, which simplifies the code and improves readability. \
    Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. The Java compiler ensures that these exceptions are either caught and handled within the method or declared in the method's throws clause, however Kotlin approach reduces boilerplate code and lets developers focus on handling only the exceptions that are relevant to the application’s logic.

    ```java
    public void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName));
        String line = reader.readLine();
        reader.close();
    }
    ```
*   **Document exceptions (Kotlin in Action):** Nevertheless, a good practice is documenting any exceptions that your functions can throw using KDoc annotations to help other developers understand the error conditions they need to handle:

    ```kotlin
    /**
     * Reads a file and returns its content as a string.
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs.
     */
    fun readFile(fileName: String): String {
        // file reading logic
    }
    ```
*   **Multiple Catch Blocks:** When handling different types of exceptions, you can use multiple `catch` blocks. This lets you handle each exception type separately, providing specific responses to different error conditions. For example, handle `IOException` and `NumberFormatException` differently to give more accurate feedback to users.

    ```kotlin
    try {
        val result = riskyFileOperation()
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        println("File operation failed: ${e.message}")
    } catch (e: NumberFormatException) {
        println("Number format issue: ${e.message}")
    }
    ```
*   **Catch the most specific exception first (Kotlin in Action)**: Plus, when you handle multiple exceptions, always catch the most specific one first. This ensures that more precise error-handling logic is applied before more general ones. For instance:

    ```kotlin
    try {
         // code that might throw exceptions
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        println("IO error: ${e.message}")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        println("General error: ${e.message}")
    }
    ```
*   **Use try-catch blocks effectively (Effective Kotlin):** Separate normal execution from error handling with well-structured try-catch blocks. This approach keeps your code organized and readable. For example:

    ```kotlin
    try {
        val fileContent = readFile("data.txt")
        println(fileContent)
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        println("Failed to read file: ${e.message}")
    }
    ```
*   **Integrate with Coroutines (Effective Kotlin):** In asynchronous code, use Kotlin's Coroutine framework to handle exceptions effectively. For instance, use `try-catch` within a coroutine context to manage exceptions:

    ```kotlin
    launch {
        try {
            val result = fetchData()
            println("Data: $result")
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("Error fetching data: ${e.message}")
        }
    }
    ```
* **Consider the layer when throwing an exception:** Always keep in mind which layer you are throwing or ignoring exceptions. For a robust application, the user shouldn't experience app crashes, which means throwing exceptions in the Domain layer is not acceptable and everything should be handled within this layer or have some fallback mechanisms in place. By ensuring that exceptions are managed appropriately at each layer, you can maintain a smooth user experience and prevent unexpected crashes.

**4. Conclusion**

That's all the best practices regarding exception handling I collected based on my experience or from books like "Kotlin in Action" and "Effective Kotlin". Please write in the comments which other best practices you use in your project, and if you have more tips for other developers.

Also, if you liked this video do not forget to share it with the other Kotlin developers.
