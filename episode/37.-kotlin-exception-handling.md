# 37. Kotlin: Exception Handling

## Best Practices of Exception Handling in Kotlin

**1. Introduction**

* **Greetings and Channel Introduction**
* **Video Overview:** This video will cover the basics and best practices of exception handling in Kotlin. Handling exceptions gracefully in Android applications is not just a best practice; it's an essential component of providing a reliable and positive user experience. Here’s why:
  1. **Prevents Crashes:** Unhandled exceptions can cause applications to crash abruptly. This not only frustrates users but can also lead to data loss and other issues.
  2. **Maintains User Trust:** Regular crashes can erode user confidence in an application. Handling exceptions properly helps to maintain a smooth, consistent user experience, which is crucial for retaining users.
  3. **Improves Debugging:** Graceful handling of exceptions allows developers to log errors and other vital information without halting the application. This can simplify the debugging process and make it easier to identify and fix underlying issues.
  4. **Enhances Security:** Unhandled exceptions can expose vulnerabilities and sensitive information. By managing exceptions thoughtfully, you can better safeguard the application and its data.
  5. **User Experience Continuity:** Handling exceptions ensures that users can continue their tasks even if something goes wrong. This can be achieved by displaying user-friendly error messages or fallback content.

In essence, handling exceptions gracefully in Android development is crucial for building robust, user-friendly applications that users can trust and rely on. It ensures that, even when things go awry, your application remains stable and functional.

**2. Basics of Exception Handling in Kotlin**

* **Definition of Exceptions:** Exceptions are unexpected events that occur during program execution, disrupting the normal flow. They can arise from various issues like invalid input, network failures, or resource constraints.
*   **Throwing Exceptions:** In Kotlin, you use the `throw` keyword to raise an exception manually. This is useful when you need to indicate an error state that the program should handle, such as throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` when a method receives invalid arguments.

    ```kotlin
    fun validateAge(age: Int) {
        if (age < 0) {
            throw IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative")
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Catching Exceptions:** The `try-catch` block in Kotlin allows you to catch and handle exceptions. By enclosing code that might throw exceptions in a `try` block and providing `catch` blocks for different types of exceptions, you can manage errors without crashing your application.

    ```kotlin
    try {
        val result = riskyOperation()
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        println("Caught an IOException: ${e.message}")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        println("Caught a general exception: ${e.message}")
    }
    ```
*   **Exceptions Are Bound to the Function Stack:** When an exception is thrown in Kotlin (or any JVM language), the JVM captures the current state of the call stack. This stack trace includes information about the sequence of method calls that led to the exception. If you start a new stack (for example, by creating a new thread or using a coroutine), the exception handling context changes. Each thread or coroutine has its own call stack. If an exception is thrown within a new stack, it will only propagate within that stack. This means that exceptions thrown in a new thread or coroutine won't be caught by catch blocks in the original stack:

    ```kotlin
    fun main() {
        try {
            Thread {
                throw RuntimeException("Exception in new thread") // Won't be caught!
            }.start()
        } catch (e: RuntimeException) {
            println("Caught exception: ${e.message}")
        }
    }
    ```

**3. Best Practices**

*   **Avoid using exceptions for normal control flow (Kotlin in Action)**: Exceptions in Kotlin are meant to handle truly exceptional situations, not to manage routine tasks. Using exceptions for regular control flow can make the code harder to read and degrade performance. Instead, use conditional logic or other control structures.  Also, throwing exceptions in Kotlin, as in many other programming languages, can be considered expensive due to several reasons:

    1. **Performance Overhead**: When an exception is thrown, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) needs to capture the current state of the stack, which involves creating a stack trace. This process is computationally intensive and can slow down the application
    2. **Memory Usage**: Creating an exception object and its stack trace consumes memory. If exceptions are thrown frequently, this can lead to increased memory usage and potentially cause garbage collection issues
    3. **Control Flow Disruption**: Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of the program, which can make the code harder to read and maintain. This disruption can lead to less efficient code paths being executed
    4. **Error Handling Complexity**: Handling exceptions properly requires additional code for try-catch blocks, which can make the codebase more complex and harder to manage

    For example, instead of throwing an exception when a list is empty, you could use a conditional check:

    ```kotlin
    val list = listOf<Int>()
    if (list.isEmpty()) {
        println("List is empty")
    } else {
        println("First element: ${list[0]}")
    }
    ```
*   **Use Kotlin's built-in exception classes (Kotlin in Action)**: Kotlin provides a variety of standard exception classes that should be used for common error scenarios. This ensures consistency and readability. The `require()` function is a simple way to validate input arguments in Kotlin. It throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the condition isn't met, helping you catch issues early in the code execution. For example, use `require(age > 0) { "Age must be positive" }` to ensure age is a positive number.

    ```kotlin
    fun setAge(age: Int) {
        require(age > 0) { "Age must be positive" }
        // Proceed with setting age
    }
    ```
*   **Use precondition functions (Kotlin in Action)**: Kotlin provides functions like `require()`, `requireNotNull()`, `check()`, and `error()` to simplify precondition checks and fail-fast and handling errors as early as possible and automatically throw exceptions. These functions make your code cleaner and more readable:

    ```kotlin
    fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        require(b != 0) { "Denominator cannot be zero" }
        return a / b
    }
    ```
*   **Create custom exceptions when needed (Kotlin in Action)**: For scenarios that are unique to your application, create custom exceptions. This makes it easier to understand and handle specific error cases. Here's an example of a custom exception:

    ```kotlin
    class InvalidUserInputException(message: String) : Exception(message)
    ​
    fun validateUserInput(input: String) {
        if (input.isBlank()) {
            throw InvalidUserInputException("Input cannot be blank")
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Prefer using standard library exceptions (Kotlin in Action)**: Stick to exceptions provided by the Kotlin standard library for common error cases. They are well-documented and familiar to other developers. For example, use `IllegalStateException` for method calls that are illegal in a particular state:

    ```kotlin
    fun processOrder(order: Order) {
        check(order.isValid) { "Order is not valid" }
        // processing logic
    }
    ```
*   **Handle nullability properly (Effective Kotlin):** Leveraging Kotlin's null-safety features prevents `NullPointerExceptions` and improves code safety. Use the `?` operator to handle nullable types safely:

    ```kotlin
    val name: String? = getName()
    println(name?.toUpperCase() ?: "Name is null")
    ```
* **Avoiding Checked Exceptions:** Unlike Java, Kotlin doesn't have checked exceptions, which simplifies the code and improves readability. This approach reduces boilerplate code and lets developers focus on handling only the exceptions that are relevant to the application’s logic.
*   **Document exceptions (Kotlin in Action):** Clearly documenting any exceptions that your functions can throw helps other developers understand the error conditions they need to handle. Use KDoc to annotate your functions:

    ```kotlin
    /**
     * Reads a file and returns its content as a string.
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs.
     */
    fun readFile(fileName: String): String {
        // file reading logic
    }
    ```
*   **Multiple Catch Blocks:** When handling different types of exceptions, you can use multiple `catch` blocks. This lets you handle each exception type separately, providing specific responses to different error conditions. For example, handle `IOException` and `NumberFormatException` differently to give more accurate feedback to users.

    ```kotlin
    try {
        val result = riskyFileOperation()
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        println("File operation failed: ${e.message}")
    } catch (e: NumberFormatException) {
        println("Number format issue: ${e.message}")
    }
    ```
*   **Catch the most specific exception first (Kotlin in Action)**: When you handle multiple exceptions, always catch the most specific one first. This ensures that more precise error handling logic is applied before more general ones. For instance:

    ```kotlin
    try {
         // code that might throw exceptions
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        println("IO error: ${e.message}")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        println("General error: ${e.message}")
    }
    ```
*   **Use try-catch blocks effectively (Effective Kotlin):** Separate normal execution from error handling with well-structured try-catch blocks. This approach keeps your code organized and readable. For example:

    ```kotlin
    try {
        val fileContent = readFile("data.txt")
        println(fileContent)
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        println("Failed to read file: ${e.message}")
    }
    ```
*   **Integrate with coroutines (Effective Kotlin):** In asynchronous code, use Kotlin's coroutine framework to handle exceptions effectively. For instance, use `try-catch` within a coroutine context to manage exceptions:

    ```kotlin
    launch {
        try {
            val result = fetchData()
            println("Data: $result")
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("Error fetching data: ${e.message}")
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Consider using \`Result\<T>\` or `sealed class/interface`:** This approach not only makes error handling more explicit but also improves the readability and maintainability of your code. By clearly separating success and error paths, you can avoid the performance overhead associated with exceptions and embrace a more functional programming style. This leads to more predictable and efficient code, aligning well with Kotlin's emphasis on safety and clarity.

    #### Example with `Result`

    ```kotlin
    fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): Result<Int> {
        return if (b != 0) {
            Result.success(a / b)
        } else {
            Result.failure(IllegalArgumentException("Division by zero"))
        }
    }

    val result = divide(4, 2)
    result.fold(
        onSuccess = { println("Result: $it") },
        onFailure = { println("Error: ${it.message}") }
    )
    ```

    #### Example with Sealed Class

    ```kotlin
    sealed interface DivisionResult {
        data class Success(val result: Int) : DivisionResult()
        data class Error(val message: String) : DivisionResult()
    }

    fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): DivisionResult {
        return if (b != 0) {
            DivisionResult.Success(a / b)
        } else {
            DivisionResult.Error("Division by zero")
        }
    }

    val result = divide(4, 2)
    when (result) {
        is DivisionResult.Success -> println("Result: ${result.result}")
        is DivisionResult.Error -> println("Error: ${result.message}")
    }
    ```
