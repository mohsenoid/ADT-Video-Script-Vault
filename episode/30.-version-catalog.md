# 30. Version Catalog

## Version Catalog



Hello Android Developers,\


I am back with another video about the Gradle build system feature called “Version Catalog”. In this video, you will learn what version catalog is, how to use it, and what benefits it offers for dependency management.

I will also share my experiment using it in one of my huge projects in production with more than 50 modules spread in different repositories and I found it useful for dependency management.



But before we start if you are interested in Android development and like to watch videos about it and get to know other Android developers or active companies in this field do not forget to subscribe to this channel cause this is exactly what I do.



Let's start...



Version catalog is a Gradle build system feature that allows you to declare your dependencies and their versions in a separate configuration file, and then use type-safe accessors to reference them in your build scripts and it allows you to manage the dependencies of your project in a centralized way. This way, you can easily update, reuse, and share the dependency information across your project and with other developers.

As you can see in this example, instead of declaring a dependency using a string notation, you can use a catalog name that provides auto-completion and validation in the IDE.



Version catalog is available in Gradle version 7, and got stable in Gradle 8.\


Android Studio Giraffe came with an experimental feature that allows you to start a project using Kotlin DSL and Version Catalog.



Let's create a new project and check the differences:



…\


First, let’s look into the “settings.gradle” file

…

Now let’s check the file created called “libs.versions.toml” in your root project’s gradle folder. This is where you define your versions, libraries, and plugins in different sections.\


The versions section defines variables that hold the versions of your dependencies and plugins. The libraries section defines your dependencies using the group, name, and version.ref attributes. The plugins section defines your plugins using the id and version.ref attributes.

Bundle



You can use different naming conventions for your aliases, such as kebab case (e.g., androidx-ktx), snake case (e.g., groovy\_core), or camel case (e.g., androidApplication). However, recommended name convention is a mixture of kebab case and camelCase for better code completion assistance in your build files.

Once you have defined your version catalog, you can use it in your build scripts by using the libs prefix.

…\


Here is a list of pros and cons that you may want to consider before using it:

### Pros:

* It provides type-safe accessors for your dependencies, which means you can use autocompletion and avoid typos in your build scripts.
* It makes your build scripts more concise and readable, as you don’t have to repeat the group, artifact, and version for each dependency.
* It enables you to share and reuse dependency versions across multiple projects, which can help avoid duplication and inconsistency of dependency versions across your modules or even different projects.
* It supports dependency bundles, which are groups of dependencies that are commonly used together. This can simplify your dependency declaration and avoid conflicts[1](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html).
* It allows you to separate the version from the dependency coordinates, and use version references instead. This can give you more flexibility and control over the dependency versions[1](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html).

### Cons, up to this point in time and version:

* It is overkill for a project with a single module and just makes your life harder.
* It is not supported by some tools or plugins that rely on the traditional way of declaring dependencies.
* It does not allow you to use advanced features of dependency management, such as dependency excludes, substitutions, or constraints. You can only use them as artifact declarations.
* It is not compatible with older versions of Gradle, so you may need to upgrade your Gradle wrapper and plugins to use it.

Publishing TOML file\
Gradle offers a version catalog plugin, which offers the ability to declare, then publish a catalog.

\\\[INTRO]\\

Hey everyone, welcome to my YouTube channel! In today's video, we're going to dive into the Gradle build system and explore a powerful feature called the Version Catalog. If you've ever struggled with managing dependencies and versions in your projects, then this video is for you. So let's get started!

\


\\\[WHAT IS A VERSION CATALOG]\\

First, let's understand what a Version Catalog is in the context of Gradle. A Version Catalog is a fantastic tool that helps you centralize and organize version information for your project's dependencies. Instead of scattering version numbers across multiple files, a Version Catalog allows you to define versions in a single, dedicated block in your build.gradle file.

\


\\\[SETTING UP A VERSION CATALOG]\\

Now, let's see how easy it is to set up a Version Catalog in your Gradle project. To get started, all you need to do is create a new \`versionCatalog\` block in your build.gradle file. Inside this block, you can define and add versions for your project's dependencies. It's as simple as that!

\


\\\[USING THE VERSION CATALOG]\\

Once you've set up your Version Catalog, you can start using it in your project. Instead of manually specifying version numbers for your dependencies in the dependencies section, you can now reference the versions from your Version Catalog. This makes it incredibly easy to update a library's version. Just make the change in the Version Catalog, and the rest of your project will automatically pick up the new version.

\


\\\[ADDITIONAL FEATURES]\\

Now, let's quickly overview some additional features of Gradle's Version Catalog. One handy feature is the ability to handle dynamic versions. You can define dynamic ranges, such as using "+" for automatic version updates. You can even mix static and dynamic versions in your dependencies. The Version Catalog gives you flexibility in managing your dependencies without compromising stability.

\


\\\[CONCLUSION]\\

In conclusion, Gradle's Version Catalog feature is a game-changer when it comes to managing versions and dependencies in your projects. It saves you time and effort by centralizing version information and making updates a breeze. I encourage you to explore this feature and start using it in your own projects.
